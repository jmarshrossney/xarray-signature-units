`xarray-annotated` enables run-time validation and conversion of `xarray.DataArray` units
declared in function signatures via
[`typing.Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated).

It bridges [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
[pint-xarray](https://pint-xarray.readthedocs.io) — which provide the units registry and the
underlying conversion machinery — with the units you declare in a signature, so each declared
unit is checked and coerced whenever the function runs.
([cf-xarray](https://cf-xarray.readthedocs.io) is an optional dependency for CF/UDUNITS unit
strings.)

!!! note

    Right now `xarray-annotated` supports declaring and validating physical **units**
    only. The intention is to grow it to cover a DataArray's full xarray *schema* — its
    **dims, coords, and dtype** — under the same `typing.Annotated` mechanism (the
    `xarray_annotated.schema` subpackage reserves this and is currently a stub).

For example:

```python
from typing import Annotated
import xarray as xr
from xarray_annotated.units import declare_units

@declare_units
def normalise_pressure(
    p: Annotated[xr.DataArray, "Pa"],
) -> Annotated[xr.DataArray, "Pa"]:
    return p

p = xr.DataArray([1013.0, 1000.0], attrs={"units": "hPa"})
normalise_pressure(p)
# <xarray.DataArray (dim_0: 2)>
# array([101300., 100000.])
# Attributes:
#     units:    Pa
```

## Motivations

`xarray.DataArray`s often carry a physical unit as a free-form string in their `units` attribute
(`"hPa"`, `"degC"`, `"g m-2 d-1"`).
Nothing enforces that the array a function receives is actually in the unit that function expects,
so it is quite easy to mess up — mixing `hPa`/`Pa` or `m`/`mm`, or even feeding in dimensionally
incompatible data.
Tools like [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
[pint-xarray](https://pint-xarray.readthedocs.io) offer robust mechanisms for validating and
converting the units attached to a `DataArray`, but enforcement is left up to the user, and
manually declaring and enforcing a units policy everywhere is quite a lot of effort.

`xarray-annotated` helps by providing a transparent and low-effort policy for the
declaration and validation/conversion of units on `xarray.DataArray`s.
Specifically,

1. Letting you declare the expected unit of a `DataArray` **in the function signature** —
   `Annotated[xr.DataArray, "Pa"]`, or the self-identifying `Annotated[xr.DataArray, Unit("Pa")]`
   marker that composes cleanly with other `Annotated` metadata markers — so the unit is part of
   the contract, written in exactly one place.
2. Validating and converting arrays against those declarations at run time, under a switchable
   policy, via the `@declare_units` decorator (or the `check_units` primitive it is built on).

Attaching metadata to type hints with `typing.Annotated` is an increasingly common pattern in the
Python ecosystem, used by libraries such as [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/),
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).
A declared unit sits naturally alongside other typed metadata rather than in a separate schema.

## Installation

`xarray-annotated` can be installed directly from GitHub using `pip`, or tools
such as `uv` that wrap around it.

=== "uv (recommended)"

    ```sh
    uv add git+https://github.com/jmarshrossney/xarray-annotated.git
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```sh
    pip install git+https://github.com/jmarshrossney/xarray-annotated.git
    ```

CF-convention / UDUNITS unit strings (e.g. `"umol m-2 s-1"`) need the optional `cf`
extra, which pulls in [cf-xarray](https://cf-xarray.readthedocs.io):

=== "uv (recommended)"

    ```sh
    uv add "xarray-annotated[cf] @ git+https://github.com/jmarshrossney/xarray-annotated.git"
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```sh
    pip install "xarray-annotated[cf] @ git+https://github.com/jmarshrossney/xarray-annotated.git"
    ```

Currently Python versions equal to or above 3.12 are supported.

## Overview of usage

There are two steps.

1. **Declare** the expected unit of each `DataArray` in your function signatures, as
   `Annotated[xr.DataArray, "<unit>"]` metadata.
2. **Apply** the declarations — decorate the function with `@declare_units` to
   validate and convert its inputs and stamp its outputs automatically, or call
   `check_units(...)` directly where you'd rather not decorate.

See the [Usage](usage.md) guide for the full walkthrough — the validation policy, choosing a pint
vs. CF registry, and reading declarations off a signature for your own tooling — and the
[API reference](api.md) for the complete surface.

## Philosophy

`xarray-annotated` is a deliberately thin layer over
[pint-xarray](https://pint-xarray.readthedocs.io) (and, optionally,
[cf-xarray](https://cf-xarray.readthedocs.io)): pint does all the arithmetic and conversion; this
package only adds unit *declaration* and *validation*.
It is not a units engine, nor a general units accessor (that space is already served, e.g. by the
Astropy-based [xarray-units](https://github.com/astropenguin/xarray-units)).

This is by design: the aim is to work seamlessly alongside those tools without ever getting in the
way.
I developed it to serve a specific purpose in my own work, and don't plan to make it significantly
more complex or feature-rich — but please feel free to raise an
[issue](https://github.com/jmarshrossney/xarray-annotated/issues) or open a
[pull request](https://github.com/jmarshrossney/xarray-annotated/pulls) to suggest a change
or feature.
